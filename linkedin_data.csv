Another rewrote part of our onboarding flow, without being asked, and improved it. They weren’t waiting for permission. They just wanted the opportunity to prove themselves.No LinkedIn background or long resume. Just real hunger.Most companies won’t even look at a 16-year-old applicant.

Constantly.My strategy was to DM and email experienced strangers and say:“I’m working on a startup and need some honest advice. Could I setup a quick meeting?”Mentors didn’t just help me build the startup. They taught me how to make decisions, manage people, and lead. Not to mention, they became valuable additions to my network.Some of the best tools I’ve used, completely free: MicroMentor – 1:1 mentoring for entrepreneurs, founders, and career seekers around the world Score.org – free mentoring from business professionals with decades of experience PushFar – a powerful mentorship platform to connect with experienced professionals in your field YouTube – yes, if you follow the right people, it can become a personal MBAYou can even go to your school’s LinkedIn page, search for alumni by industry, and reach out to them directly, I’ve done it over 50 times myself.The truth is: You don’t need a crazy background to get guidance. You need curiosity, humility, and the willingness to ask.I’m still learning every day. But I wouldn’t be here without the people who replied to those early messages. So please take a moment to reach out and set up a meeting with someone in the industry you want to learn from. Just remember to be extremely appreciative of their time.

This is because :- Data Science roles are more of research and programming and companies prefer someone who has a research background probably someone with a Masters or a PhD in Data Science for these roles.- ⁠The demand for these roles is there but as experienced engineers and not freshers.- ⁠Doing only Data Science Courses would not get you a job, your CV requires real skills.- ⁠For these roles, companies won’t come to hire - you have to showcase your skillset in Kaggle competitions or Data Science Hackathons and you will get these roles.- ⁠Doing internships in smaller startups during college would be very helpful if you are clear that you are built for Data Science roles.But even if you are looking for such roles, the advice would be to strengthen your problem solving skills, learn fundamentals of computer science and this will open you various avenues. For e.g. You get hired in an MNC for a Software role but you can work there and switch internally to a Data Science role if you have skills.So its not about the role, but more about how well you are with the skillset and hunger - you will ace it.This was Day 2 , see you in Day 3 of hashtag#CampusStories where we decode Placement Season of this year :)",3,301,1734

We take time.We’ve missed some opportunities by not chasing trends — and that’s okay.Because our focus has never been to “blow up.”It’s been to build up — brick by brick, with the community, for the long run.From being a course catalog →We’re now moving towards a complete 1-stop learning platform —for both college students and working professionals.Live classes, structured pathways, mentorship, doubt support, and everything else a learner truly needs.Slow growth isn’t boring.It’s sustainable.It’s real.Visit codehelp: https://www.codehelp.in/",2,141,967

But in the process, I see a lot of students ignoring something that still holds massive weight in interviews:DSA.Interviews haven’t suddenly become fancy.DSA is still the go-to tool to assess your problem-solving skills, logic, and thinking under pressure.So here’s my two cents — don’t overlook it.Strengthen your fundamentals. It still matters.🎓 If you’re just getting started, my DSA playlist on YouTube is completely free.💥 And if you want to stay away from distractions, join our CodeHelp Supreme DSA community — live classes, weekly revisions, problem-solving, doubt support, and collective growth.P.S. The real intent of this post was to guide you, not to market… but koi nahi, ab toh hogya 😅Lastly — calling out to all my friends/Seniors in the industry:What’s the current DSA trend in your company’s interview process?Drop your experience in the comments — it’ll really help the students and switchers out here.Let’s guide the next wave together. 🙌🚨 Oh, and one last thing —The 50% DISCOUNT on every Code Help course ends in the next 48 HOURS.Visit Codehelp: https://lnkd.in/gNdHbWN7hashtag#DSA hashtag#CodeHelp",3,202,1302

Teaching is a noble cause. Students really look up to her.

You could have easily charged more.”There are students who value teachers. And I am deeply grateful to have built a community that truly believes in what I do.I have the experience, confidence, and track record to charge what I deserve - because I know I deliver value.I take pride in being excellent at what I do.But we need to talk about this.Wishing teachers on Teacher’s Day is not enough.Complaining about how hard it is to find good teachers is not enough.Everyone has bills to pay.

Real-time transformation, not just theory. And it did happen! :)Also… shout out to the organizing committee & Subir Mandal for pulling this off and inviting me.

I’d NEVER do that. I say this as someone who learned it the hard way.There’s always this unsaid rule, “Give them a chance, they’re your own.”But here’s what no one tells you:Your company is not your family’s charity project.It’s your vision.Your risk.Your sleepless nights.Your blood, sweat, and balance sheet.And when you hire someone just because you know them; not because they deserve the seat, you compromise everything you’ve built.I once hired someone I trusted personally. Because I thought:“Let me help them.”“They’ll understand me better.”“It’ll be easy to work with someone I already trust.”I couldn’t have been more wrong.Here’s what actually happened:→ Expected special treatment.→ Took feedback personally.→ Missed deadlines without guilt.→ And assumed I owed them flexibility just because of our personal bond.The worst part?I couldn’t even call them out the way I’d call any other employees.Because, “Gharwale kya kahenge?”And family dinners got awkward real quick. You can’t fire a cousin easily.You can’t challenge a best friend without creating rifts.And you definitely can’t build a high-performance culture when one team member thinks they are special and the rules don’t apply to them.If you’re a first-generation entrepreneur like me, you already fight too many battles.Don’t make emotional baggage one of them.It’s hard, I know.Instead:→ Hire for skill.→ Train like they owe you results, not favors.→ And keep your inner circle sacred—but out of payroll.Hire people who earn the seat.Not people you’re emotionally obligated to give it to.Build a company where relationships are earned through performance, not birthright.That’s how you protect your dream.So here’s my rule now:Help friends outside the company.Build with professionals inside it.What’s your take?hashtag#founders hashtag#startups hashtag#entrepreneurship hashtag#relationships hashtag#workculture",6,279,1940

Comments > PostsYour comment under a viral post can now reach more people than the original post.→ Top creators are seeing 20k–100k+ impressions per comment→ Meaning: You don’t need to post daily, you need to engage smartly.Find high-authority accounts. Add insight, not flattery. (Btw, I generated 200K+ impressions just by commenting)2. The Feed Now Recycles Posts From 2–3 Weeks Ago→ LinkedIn’s pushing posts that still generate dwell time or profile clicks→ This extends the life cycle of content and increases ROI on quality postsPost less often, but more intentionally. Let your good posts work longer.3. “Follow First” is Replacing “Connect”New users are now set to follow creators by default → Your audience is expanding quietly, not loudly→ More visibility, less engagement, more silent influenceWrite for the silent 90%, people who never comment, but watch everything.4. “Value Per Viewer” Is the New CurrencyLinkedIn is no longer rewarding vanity metrics→ It tracks: dwell time, saves, profile clicks, and how your post fits viewer intent→ Posts that “sound viral” but feel hollow are tankingFocus on resonance > reach. Depth > dopamine.5. Comments Are Also Creating Creator Visibility Loops→ If someone engages with your comment, LinkedIn is more likely to show them your future posts→ This creates a “loop of interest” even without followersTreat your comment section like your first impression engine.6. Your Post’s Performance Now Influences Your Profile Discoverability→ Posts with saves, re-visits, or shares trigger profile visits→ And LinkedIn now nudges those same users to follow you more aggressivelyClean up your profile headline + About.The Real Game in 2025:It’s not just “posting daily.” It’s: •	Smart commenting •	Writing for lurkers •	Optimizing for longevity •	Earning trust over time, not attention overnightThis platform is changing and your playbook should too.♻️ Repost to help someone stop chasing likes and start building leverageLinkedIn for Marketing | LinkedIn Guide to Creating hashtag#linkedinalgorithm hashtag#LinkedInGrowth hashtag#LinkedInExpert",7,360,2438

Smile more. Don’t shout.How hard could it be?As an intern, I used to judge the people leading me.“He’s too rude.”“She’s so kind, must be a great boss.“That one? Cold, must be a bad manager.”But now…I’m on the other side and I realize it’s so tough becoming a good leader.Now that I run a team at Iconify Consulting Group (ICG), I understand how much discipline, emotional control, and silent weight sits behind that “kindness.”And how being a good leader doesn’t just require empathy, it demands discernment.- It’s about holding both at the same time: kindness and clarity, empathy and accountability.- It’s knowing when to stay silent and when to speak up.- It’s knowing when to give someone a second chance…And when that second chance is hurting the rest of your team.- It’s learning to pay people who haven’t performed well and still showing up the next day without letting resentment color your tone.- It’s letting someone go not because you’re angry, but because the role needs something they no longer want to give.Some days I’ve felt like the entire agency was resting on a thread of patience.Other days, I’ve wondered if I’ll ever learn how to lead without overgiving… or shutting down.No handbook prepares you for those 10-second moments where you have to decide:Do I ignore this? Do I address it now?Do I defend this person or hold the line?I haven’t cracked it yet. But every time I talk to the clients I look up to, leaders who’ve built teams of 500, 10000, 50,000 people: I realize something.Their calm isn’t performative.Their kindness isn’t passive.It’s all built. Earned. Practiced.They’ve taught me more than any book or business post ever could:→ That power isn’t loud.→ That leadership isn’t ego.→ That the real job is showing up, again and again, without losing yourself.If you’re a leader or manager, drop your best advice below 👇 PS: A little note of thanks to some of the best bosses I’ve met, who probably don’t even realize how much they’ve taught me.Vasantha | Glenn | Bimal | Babjee M | Lauren | Carlos | Monika | Kai | Nakul You don’t just lead teams.

But how can you do it with grace?🔥 Luckily, my friend Colby made the ultimate guide 🔥Here are the 5 rules for saying “no” with respect and without guilt: 1. Instead of apologising, open with appreciation. “I appreciate your consideration, but I'm unable to handle additional responsibilities currently.2. Be completely transparent. “If I’m completely honest, I don’t currently need this. But if it changes, I’ll be sure to let you know” 3. Refer someone who is a good fit. “I can't quite give my time for this but I know the perfect person who can” 4. Keep things open for the future.“Unfortunately I’ve got too much on right now, but I’d love to take a look later on in the month” 5.

𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩, which inspire them into ownership.

Fixed them.📌 Strategy (the roadmap they follow)We adopted OKRs + Annual Operating Plans.> Break down yearly goals into quarters> Track weekly metrics> Course-correct immediately when numbers dipAfter 3–4 years of building, I finally stepped away (fully) during my first month postpartum.No panic.

It’s clear this moment is resonating across the industry, so I wanted to share a few thoughts directly here.For too long, the AI race has been a game of scale where bigger models meant better outcomes. But there is no law of physics that dictates AI models must remain big and expensive. The cost of training and inference is just another technology challenge to be solved. We’ve seen this play out before. In the early days of computing, storage and processing power were prohibitively expensive. Yet, through technological advancements and economies of scale, these costs plummeted. AI will follow the same path.At IBM, we’ve been on this journey for years. We’ve been steadfast in our belief that efficient, fit-for-purpose models can deliver exceptional value and that open is key to innovation.

By empowering the intermediaries, these marketplaces improve affordability, transparency, and doorstep delivery of seeds, fertilizers, and crop protection products.💡 IOT and ML based Advisory for Smarter Input Use - Precision agriculture tools powered by ML, remote sensing, and IoT are tailoring input recommendations based on soil health and weather data—leading to smarter, cost-effective decision-making. Companies like hashtag#Fasal and hashtag#Cropin are driving this change.📈 Embedded Financing for Agri Inputs Innovative models like pay-as-you-grow financing are reducing upfront costs for farmers. Digital credit platforms backed by NBFCs and fintech firms are helping farmers access high-quality inputs without financial strain.💬 Digitally Connected Agri-Retail Networks  - Agri input players are integrating digital touchpoints into traditional dealer and retail networks. WhatsApp-based ordering, e-Kisan Kendras, and rural digital advisory hubs are bridging the gap between online efficiencies and offline engagement.The future of agri-input retail is farmer-centric, tech-driven, and sustainability-focused.
